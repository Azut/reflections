When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working between different computers, or when more than one person is working on a single project. Also allows (if public) other users to verify, use, consult or even make suggestions over your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Mainly because you probably don't want to "share" an incomplete project or share while testing a new feature or while fixing a bug. Manually pushing your changes also offers you full control of what to make public (and at what stage).
