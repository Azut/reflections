When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working between different computers, or when more than one person is working on a single project. Also allows (if public) other users to verify, use, consult or even make suggestions over your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Mainly because you probably don't want to "share" an incomplete project or share while testing a new feature or while fixing a bug. Manually pushing your changes also offers you full control of what to make public (and at what stage).

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are basically a copy of an entire branch from another user in GitHub.
Clones is basically a local copy of a local or online branch (GitHub), in both cases from your own repositories.
Branches are series of commits with a father child relation.

Forks are used when wanting to clone a branch from another user and use modify it in your own space.
Clone is used when wanting to duplicate one of your own branches.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It allows you to work with the remote storage even if you don't have online connection to it, compare differences, etc.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
It would basically require to send the file/code, have it revised, and receive back the comments over it (or even the fixed code). It's way more cumbersome and gets easily messy on more complex projects.
